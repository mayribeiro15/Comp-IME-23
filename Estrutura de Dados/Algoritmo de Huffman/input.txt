16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not 
perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to 
save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands 
condemned already because they have not believed in the name of Godâ€™s one and only Son. 19 This is the verdict: 
Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20 
Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be 
exposed. 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they 
have done has been done in the sight of God.
